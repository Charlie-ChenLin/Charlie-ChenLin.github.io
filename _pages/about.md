## About me

I am Lin Chen (Chinese name: 陈霖, English name: Charlie), a candidate at the Master of Applied Statistics program in [School of Management](https://www.fdsm.fudan.edu.cn/en/) at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). Currently, I'm an research assistant in Prof. [Zhouhan Lin](https://hantek.github.io/)'s group at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and a research intern in [Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/)'s group in [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) I just received my bachelor's degree in Statistics in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), where I work closely with Prof. [Samuel Drapeau](https://www.samuel-drapeau.info/) and Prof. [Yiqing Lin](https://www.math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/teachershow/tags/MDAwMDAwMDAwMLKIdpc). I also collaborate with Prof. [Mathieu Laurière](https://mlauriere.github.io/) at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). 



## Research Interest

My interest lies in the application of mathematical/statistical theories to current machine learning models and algorithms, such as GFlowNets and large language models. I'm particularly intersted in how insights from the math/stat community can improve the reasoning ability and memory of large language models. I'm also interested in developing statistical tests to protect the intellectual property of LLMs.
